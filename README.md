# newsletter_api_server

This project uses Nodejs and Express to make a Newsletter email server with MailChimp Api,to create signup form.

You can use newsletter services,to send out at the same time email to your audience,that has subscribed to your newsletter via signup form.

Signup form will submit your info into Nodejs server,then send request with your data will send to api,along with the api key.

This will sign the user into our audience,if user already exists it won't signup him again.
