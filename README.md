# newsletter_api_server

Project uses Nodejs and Express to create Newsletter Email server with MailChimp Api along with signup form.

This email platform helps you manage and talk to your clients, customers, and other interested parties.

You can use newsletter services,to send out at the same time email to your audience,that has subscribed to your newsletter via signup form.

Signup form will submit your info into Nodejs server,then post request with your data will send to api,along with the api key.

This will sign user into our audience,if user already exists it won't signup him again.
